# Java Mathematical Functions
This project implements various mathematical functions and operations in Java, demonstrating concepts such as constant functions, polynomials, sums, products, differences, quotients, and root-finding methods. The program tests these functions and provides insights into their behavior through derivative calculations and Taylor polynomial approximations.

# Features
* Function Types: Supports constant functions, polynomials, and various mathematical operations.
* Testing Framework: Includes a comprehensive testing suite that evaluates function values, derivatives, and Taylor expansions.
* Root-Finding Methods: Implements bisection and Newton-Raphson methods for finding roots of polynomial functions.
* Randomized Input: Generates random input values to demonstrate the functions' performance across a wide range of scenarios.
